ARRAY LIMITATIONS =>

 fized size ,
 takes continuous memory,
 insert in between is hard
 ArrayList is not space and time complexity friendly

LINKED LIST ==>

.data stored in non continuious memory space.
.A Linked List is a linear data structure where:

.Elements are stored in nodes

 Each node contains:

 Data

 Reference (pointer) to the next node

 Unlike arrays, memory is not contiguous.

.insertion is easy time complexity => O(1)

.but fetch or or travesign or get() function occurs in time complexity O(n).


LIMITATIONS OF LINKED LIST =>

.No Random Access
.Extra Memory Overhead
.Slower Traversal
.No Backward Traversal (Singly LL)
.Binary Search Not Possible


LIST NODE =>
             public static class Node{
                int data;
                Node next;

                Node(int data){
                    this.data  = data;
                }
             }

TYPES OF LINKED LIST =>
                     SINGLY LINKED LIST
                     DOUBLY LINKED LIST
                     CIRCULAR LINKED LIST
